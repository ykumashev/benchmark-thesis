Docker compose up 

Steps to add a new verifier(donâ€™t change genesis block):
Add nodeX and volX to docker compose
bootnode -genkey 3nodes/raft/nodekeyX
geth --datadir 3nodes/dd4 account new -> cp 3nodes/dd4/keystore/* 3nodes/keys/key4
enode://$(bootnode -nodekey 3nodes/raft/nodekey4 -writeaddress)@172.16.239.14:21000?discport=0&raftport=50400
Update permissioned-nodes.json
Update the 3nodes/genesis.json file to include node4's address as a signer: MAYBE


check cluster status
docker exec -it quorum-node1 geth attach /qdata/dd/geth.ipc
raft.cluster
